# Plotly_Challenge

## Overview
During this project, our main goal is to be able to help Roza, a biological researcher, to find bacteria that have the ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. According to her research, Roza thinks some of these bacteria can be found inside the human body, so along with that information and some coding help, we are going to show you if it is true and how many bacteria with a taste of beef we have inside us. 

## Results
After great and long research along with the help of more than 500 candidates that agreed to collaborate with the research, we found out that there are some special bacteria inside human bodies that can produce the proteins that make them taste like beef. Using Javascript, we were able to create a dashboard with different charts that explain to people the different types of bacteria we found, the belly button washing frequency scrubs per week a person has, and the bacteria cultures per sample. All this information varies depending on each candidate on our team as it's shown below.

3. Lastly, we can see the results of a young lady compared with the last two candidates.

## Summary
This project does not only show there are bacteria that we can feed by just not taking care of our own personal hygiene, but that independently of gender or age, a person will always have to take in mind that the worst diseases are caused by ourselves and by our fault of not taking care of our own health.
